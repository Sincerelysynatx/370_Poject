      "longDescription": "SIIG's DP CyberSerial PCIe is a superior adapter card for you to connect additional serial devices to your system. It is designed to provide one additional RS-232 9-pin serial port to your current PCI Express-enabled desktop computer. This PCIe serial adapter card comes with one high-speed 16950 UART serial port supporting baud rates of up to 921.6Kb/s. Its built-in 128-byte FIFO buffers dramatically increase data transmit and receive speeds especially under Windows multitasking environment. The serial port can work as either standard RS-232 port, or can be configured as 5V / 12V power output for devices that require power such as handheld scanners, table scanners, POS displays, and many more. The DP CyberSerial PCIe features a 4-layer PCB (with separate layers for data and ground) to greatly reduce signal noise and loss, and an enhanced bend-resistant bracket to provide a more secure connection to the system. Additionally, this dual profile serial adapter works with PCI Express slot with different lane widths, along with the included spare low profile bracket, the DP CyberSerial PCIe can be installed in either standard height and low profile desktop systems.",

If you're planning to connect external storage to your computer, there's a good chance the enclosure will have two or more interfaces from which to choose, including USB, FireWire&#174;, and eSATA. Your computer has USB ports, may have FireWire ports, and maybe even a Thunderbolt&#8482; port, too. So if you can just plug into your computer's existing ports, why consider an eSATA card? Consider the facts that the 6 Gb/s eSATA interface offers superior performance to that of FireWire 800 and all USB interfaces, and Thunderbolt storage systems carry a price premium over eSATA storage systems. Sonnet's Tempo SATA Pro 6Gb PCIe 2.0 card is cost-effective solution for adding two high-performance eSATA ports to your computer so you can take advantage of this speedy interface.External storage systems with an eSATA interface offer great flexibility. Single drive enclosures are very handy if you need to back up data or move files from one computer to another. Many storage systems include swappable drive trays, which are perfect for managing daily backups and multiple projects. Some systems, like Sonnet's Fusion&#8482; D400QR5 and Fusion F3, feature hardware RAID controllers that manage up to four drives and enable you to create large, protected RAID volumes, yet the systems only require a single cable to connect to this pro eSATA card.",
