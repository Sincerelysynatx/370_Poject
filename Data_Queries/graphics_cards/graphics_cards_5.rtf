The PEXUSB3S44V 4-Port PCI Express USB 3.0 Card lets you add four, dedicated 5 Gbps USB 3.0 ports to your PCIe x4-enabled PC. This independent port architecture improves USB 3.0 performance by transferring data on four individual channels to your computer, giving you faster file transfers.When multiple devices are connected, traditional single bus USB 3.0 cards share your maximum bandwidth between all ports. By employing four host controller chipsets, each port operates on a separate independent transmission channel. Dedicating up to 5 Gbps to each USB port reduces performance bottlenecks, and effectively quadruples your total available to bandwidth to 20 Gbps.Enhanced with UASP support (USB Attached SCSI Protocol), this USB 3.0 controller performs up to 70% faster than conventional USB 3.0 when paired with a UASP supported enclosure (Note: UASP requires a compatible operating system). Using a more efficient protocol than the traditional USB BOT (Bulk-Only Transport), UASP technology optimizes transfers by allowing multiple commands to be processed simultaneously, significantly increasing transfer speeds for less wait time on data transfers. See our UASP test results below for further details.For high-power USB devices, this PCIe USB 3.0 card includes an optional SATA or LP4 power connector to connect to your system power supply and deliver up to 900mA of power per port to USB 3.0 bus-powered devices (500mA for USB 2.0). The USB 3.0 card also supports USB Battery Charging Specification 1.2 (Apple Mode only), letting you charge compatible Apple devices (iPhones and iPads) faster than a standard USB 3.0 port.The controller card is compliant with USB 3.0 standards while offering backward compatibility with existing USB 2.0 / 1.1 devices. For added versatility, the USB 3.0 PCIe card is equipped with a standard profile bracket and includes a low-profile/half-height bracket for installation in small form-factor computers.Backed by a StarTech.com 2-year warranty and free lifetime technical support.Improved Performance with UASPUASP is supported in Windows&#174; 8, 8.1, Server 2012 and Linux kernel 2.6.37 or later. In testing UASP performed with up to a 70% faster read / 40% faster write speed over traditional USB 3.0 at peak performance.At the same peak in testing, UASP also showed up to an 80% reduction in required processor resources.Test results were obtained using an Intel&#174; Ivy Bridge system, StarTech.com add-on USB 3.0 cards, a UASP-enabled StarTech.com enclosure, and a SATA III solid state drive.",

Using a more efficient protocol than the traditional USB BOT (Bulk-Only Transport), UASP technology optimizes transfers by allowing multiple commands to be processed simultaneously, significantly increasing transfer speeds for less wait time on data transfers. See our UASP test results below for further details.The card uses a \"stacked\" port layout that places the ports one on top of the other, enabling all four USB 3.0 ports to be external facing, while still allowing the card to fit into a small form factor/low profile computer system using the included low profile bracket.Plus, with a built-in SATA power connector, each USB port can provide up to 900mA of power to devices that draw power from a host bus connection (500mA for USB 2.0) by connecting to your computer power supply.Backed by a StarTech.com 2-year warranty and free lifetime technical support.Improved Performance with UASPUASP is supported in Windows&#174; 8, Server 2012 and Linux kernel 2.6.3 or later. In testing UASP performed with up to a 70% faster read / 40% faster write speed over traditional USB 3.0 at peak performance.At the same peak in testing, UASP also showed up to an 80% reduction in required processor resources.Test results were obtained using an Intel&#174; Ivy Bridge system, StarTech.com add-on USB 3.0 cards, a UASP-enabled StarTech.com enclosure, and a SATA III solid state drive.",

This 10 Gb NIC offers a cost-effective solution for your file or application server or even a high-powered workstation to transfer more data, faster.Fully compliant with the IEEE 802.3an 10GBASE-T standard, the card offers added bandwidth over standard Cat 6a cabling, to meet your network needs without an overhaul of your infrastructure wiring, or a costly upgrade to fiber. The 10 Gbps network card also offers compatibility with VMWare&#174; ESXi 5.0/5.1 and Microsoft Hyper-V&#174; virtualization software and iSCSI support to combine LAN and SAN functions.For peak operating efficiency, the 10GBASE-T card features the Tehuti TN9210 chipset, compliant with 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet and with significantly reduced power consumption versus the popular Intel&#174; X540-T1 chipset. The reduced power consumption also helps to minimize heat generated by the card, to avoid increasing the operating temperature within your server case.  The card also supports 16K Jumbo Frames, 802.1q VLAN tagging and is backward compatible with 1 Gbps and 100 Mbps network connections.

H.264 encoding for wide device compatibility    The included software encodes in H.264, the most widely adopted video codec in the world, ensuring your video captures will be compatible with almost any device platform such as PC, Mac&#174;, iOS&#174; and Android&#8482; with no editing or converting required. H.264 is also widely supported by most software titles including Adobe Premiere&#174; and Windows Media&#174; Encoder. Plus, the software not only lets you capture and export videos, but it also lets you take screenshots, schedule recordings and instantly stream your video source over the Internet using online services such as Twitch or Justin.TV.   This card is capable of capturing lossless raw video making it compatible with Microsoft&#174; DirectShow. With raw video capture you can record video using your preferred third party DirectShow software such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).   Flexible input solutions for convenient compatibility   With multiple A/V input options you can capture from a wide variety of sources including HDMI, DVI, VGA, and component. You can also use this capture card with A/V adapters to record other video sources such as SDI using our SDI to HDMI converter (SDI2HD). Support for a variety of A/V devices is ideal for archiving analog video footage into a digital database.
