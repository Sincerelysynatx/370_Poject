We've listened to all your requests and the new Twin Frozr V is smaller, features stronger fans, generates less noise, keeps your graphics card and its components cooler and matches perfectly with your MSI GAMING motherboard including some funky LED lightning. We've spent 18 months on the development of the Twin Frozr V, including field testing in gaming caf&#191;s to ensure the cards have the quality and stability to give you the FPS you need  TORX Fan Traditional Fan Blade Maximizes downwards airflow and air dispersion to the massive heat sink below.  Dispersion Fan Blade  Generates more airflow to maximize air dissipation to heat sink.  Airflow Diagram  Advanced Dispersion Blade design generates 19% more airflow without increasing drag for supreme silent performance  SuperSU PIPE Enhanced dissipation efficiency SuperSU Architecture is the best cooling solution for graphics cards. The GPU is cooled by a massive nickel-plated copper base plate connected to Super Pipes (8mm heat pipes) on the MSI GAMING series graphics card. Additionally, the new heat pipe layout increases efficiency by reducing the length of unused heat pipe and a special SU-form design.  zero frozr Smart cooling, stay quiet. MSI's Twin Frozr V Thermal Designs are equipped with Zero Frozr technology which was first introduced by MSI back in 2008. Zero Frozr technology eliminates fan noise in low-load situations by stopping the fans when they are not needed. Compared to other graphics cards, there is no continuous hum of airflow to tell you there's a powerful graphics card in your gaming rig. This means you can focus on gaming without the distraction of other sounds coming from your PC.  AIRFLOW CONTROL Enhanced dissipation efficiency MSI has fitted Twin Frozr coolers with the all new Airflow Control technology which guides more airflow directly onto the heat pipes by using special deflectors on the heat sink. In addition, this exclusive heat sink design increases heat sink surface area, greatly enhancing the dissipation efficiency.
