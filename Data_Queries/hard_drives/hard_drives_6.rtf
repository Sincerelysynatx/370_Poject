      "longDescription": "WD Purple NV Surveillance Storage  WD offers you the Power of Choice when it comes to equipping a surveillance system for your home or business with the addition of the WD Purple NV hard drive. Designed specifically for NVR digital surveillance systems, the WD Purple NV hard drive adds support for systems with higher drive bay configurations and up to 64 HD cameras. The increased number of video streams and workload capability offered with the WD Purple NV hard drive allows you to scale beyond the limitations of DVR systems where only the WD Purple drive is applicable.   NVR vs DVR  WD offers you the Power of Choice when it comes to equipping a surveillance system for your home or business with the addition of WD Purple NV. Designed specifically for scalable network video recorder (NVR) surveillance systems, WD Purple NV adds support for systems with higher drive bay configurations and up to 64 high-definition cameras. The expanded workload capability of WD Purple NV hard drives enables the ability to handle increased video streams, allowing you to scale beyond the limitations of DVR systems where only WD Purple is applicable   Increased Capabilities  Designed for higher temperatures and always-on surveillance environments, WD Purple NV hard drives expand support for higher hard drive bay configurations, systems utilizing up to 64 high-definition cameras, hardware vibration sensors and greater workloads per year when compared to WD Purple hard drives. Included with the increased support, WD Purple NV is also backwards compatible with DVR systems.   Support for High Camera count Systems  WD Purple NV hard drives are optimized to support systems utilizing high-definition surveillance cameras, giving you the flexibility to upgrade and expand your security system in the future. Higher storage capacities also allow you to store the surveillance footage for a longer period of time, especially in situations when every second counts. The specific number of cameras that can be supported will be dependent on a number of criteria including but not limited to; types and capability of cameras installed (resolution, frames per second, additional features) and the system's hardware and software capability.   Premium Protection  Designed with tarnish resistant components, WD Purple NV hard drives offer premium protection in harsh environments where surveillance systems are commonly installed including outdoor cabinets where moisture and other natural elements may be present. This increased protection adds reliability to the hard drive over time, especially compared to desktop drives.   3-year limited warranty  WD Purple NV hard drives are backed by an impressive 3-year limited warranty (worldwide) giving you peace of mind that your precious surveillance footage is secure no matter where you are in the world.   Lower power consumption  Low power consumption is crucial in high-temperature always-on surveillance environments. With exclusive IntelliSeek technology, WD Purple NV hard drives calculate the optimum seek speeds which lowers power consumption, noise and vibration that can damage and cause drives to wear out more quickly, increasing reliability.",
