With every new generation of MSI Twin Frozr we give you less noise and heat!. We've listened to all your requests and the new Twin Frozr V is smaller, features stronger fans, generates less noise, keeps your graphics card and its components cooler and matches perfectly with your MSI GAMING motherboard including some funky LED lightning. We've spent 18 months on the development of the Twin Frozr V, including field testing in gaming caf&#191;s to ensure the cards have the quality and stability to give you the FPS you need  TORX Fan Traditional Fan Blade Maximizes downwards airflow and air dispersion to the massive heat sink below.  Dispersion Fan Blade  Generates more airflow to maximize air dissipation to heat sink.  Airflow Diagram  Advanced Dispersion Blade design generates 19% more airflow without increasing drag for supreme silent performance  SuperSU PIPE Enhanced dissipation efficiency SuperSU Architecture is the best cooling solution for graphics cards. The GPU is cooled by a massive nickel-plated copper base plate connected to Super Pipes (8mm heat pipes) on the MSI GAMING series graphics card. Additionally, the new heat pipe layout increases efficiency by reducing the length of unused heat pipe and a special SU-form design.  zero frozr Smart cooling, stay quiet. MSI's Twin Frozr V Thermal Designs are equipped with Zero Frozr technology which was first introduced by MSI back in 2008. Zero Frozr technology eliminates fan noise in low-load situations by stopping the fans when they are not needed. Compared to other graphics cards, there is no continuous hum of airflow to tell you there's a powerful graphics card in your gaming rig. This means you can focus on gaming without the distraction of other sounds coming from your PC.  AIRFLOW CONTROL Enhanced dissipation efficiency MSI has fitted Twin Frozr coolers with the all new Airflow Control technology which guides more airflow directly onto the heat pipes by using special deflectors on the heat sink. In addition, this exclusive heat sink design increases heat sink surface area, greatly enhancing the dissipation efficiency.

If you're planning to connect external storage to your computer, there's a good chance the enclosure will have two or more interfaces from which to choose, including USB, FireWire&#174;, and eSATA. Your computer has USB ports, may have FireWire ports, and maybe even a Thunderbolt&#8482; port, too. So if you can just plug into your computer's existing ports, why consider an eSATA card? Consider the facts that the 6 Gb/s eSATA interface offers superior performance to that of FireWire 800 and all USB interfaces, and Thunderbolt storage systems carry a price premium over eSATA storage systems. Sonnet's Tempo SATA Pro 6Gb PCIe 2.0 card is cost-effective solution for adding two high-performance eSATA ports to your computer so you can take advantage of this speedy interface.External storage systems with an eSATA interface offer great flexibility. Single drive enclosures are very handy if you need to back up data or move files from one computer to another. Many storage systems include swappable drive trays, which are perfect for managing daily backups and multiple projects. Some systems, like Sonnet's Fusion&#8482; D400QR5 and Fusion F3, feature hardware RAID controllers that manage up to four drives and enable you to create large, protected RAID volumes, yet the systems only require a single cable to connect to this pro eSATA card.|http://img.bbystatic.com/BestBuy_US/images/mp/products/1308/1308977/1308977155/1308977155_105x210_sc.jpg|http://img.bbystatic.com/BestBuy_US/images/mp/products/1308/1308977/1308977155/1308977155_54x108_s.gif|http://www.bestbuy.com/site/sonnet-tempo-sata-pro-6gb-pcie-2-0/1308977155.p?id=mp1308977155&skuId=1308977155|1308977155|null

The PEXUSB3S44V 4-Port PCI Express USB 3.0 Card lets you add four, dedicated 5 Gbps USB 3.0 ports to your PCIe x4-enabled PC. This independent port architecture improves USB 3.0 performance by transferring data on four individual channels to your computer, giving you faster file transfers.When multiple devices are connected, traditional single bus USB 3.0 cards share your maximum bandwidth between all ports. By employing four host controller chipsets, each port operates on a separate independent transmission channel. Dedicating up to 5 Gbps to each USB port reduces performance bottlenecks, and effectively quadruples your total available to bandwidth to 20 Gbps.Enhanced with UASP support (USB Attached SCSI Protocol), this USB 3.0 controller performs up to 70% faster than conventional USB 3.0 when paired with a UASP supported enclosure (Note: UASP requires a compatible operating system). Using a more efficient protocol than the traditional USB BOT (Bulk-Only Transport), UASP technology optimizes transfers by allowing multiple commands to be processed simultaneously, significantly increasing transfer speeds for less wait time on data transfers. See our UASP test results below for further details.For high-power USB devices, this PCIe USB 3.0 card includes an optional SATA or LP4 power connector to connect to your system power supply and deliver up to 900mA of power per port to USB 3.0 bus-powered devices (500mA for USB 2.0).
