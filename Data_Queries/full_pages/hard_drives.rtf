CloudSpeed SSDs use SanDisk's Guardian Technology&#8482; platform to increase endurance up to 5x higher than other multi-level cell (MLC) SSDs, providing server and database computing customers with a reliable alternative to hard disk drives at a competitive cost.Email / MessagingEmail and messaging have become essential pieces of official \"records\" for businesses and organizations. They must be accurately maintained for legal and compliance purposes. In everyday business, emails are the \"glue\" of daily business, allowing teams in many locations to collaborate on work projects-and achieve business goals together. Flash storage delivers high-volume email updates safely and securely to their destinations, supporting the daily flow of business processes.Financial TransactionsFinancial services applications primarily involve transactional services, data analytics, and market simulations. Given the speed at which markets move and stock prices change, each of these applications is time-sensitive, and application performance can affect the outcome of business decisions that are based on transactional data.SanDisk data center storage solutions speed the processing and support scale-up of applications as demand grows-which makes SSDs an important ingredient in improving the performance of financial applications.E-CommerceE-Commerce applications provide faster, more efficient interchanges of data between groups, such as business to business (B to B), and business to consumer (B to C). The capabilities of email, to provide direct and quick communications, are now blending with aspects of social media, providing immediacy, quick response times, and ongoing communication.",
