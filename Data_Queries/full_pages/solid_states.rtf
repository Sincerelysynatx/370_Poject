Your computer should be ready when you are - not the other way around. Make long wait times a thing of the past by loading apps in seconds, booting up almost instantly, and accelerating nearly everything on your computer. Get more done and have more fun with the Crucial BX200 SSD. More than 13x faster than a typical hard drive Accessing your data on the Crucial BX200 is like flipping a light switch - it's almost instant. The Crucial BX200 delivers true 540 MB/s sequential reads on both compressible and incompressible data, which allows you to access files and apps almost as soon as you click on them. Stop pulling your hair out waiting for your computer to catch up to you. Life moves fast - your computer should too. More than 40x more energy efficient than a typical hard drive Since SSDs access data on cutting-edge flash memory chips rather than on outdated spinning platters, they consume significantly less power than hard drives. Enjoy the ability to do more with longer battery life and experience a cooler, quieter system. Increase your laptop's portability, worry less about finding an outlet, and boost your productivity.More durable than a typical hard drive Since SSDs don't use moving parts that wear out over time, your photos, music, videos, and everything on the drive is less susceptible to a crash. Dropping a laptop with a hard drive may damage the small mechanical parts it uses to read and write data, and could cause the hard drive to fail. SSDs can sustain more physical trauma since they don't rely on these mechanical parts.Better value than a typical SSD The Crucial BX200 leverages proven flash memory technology that's been thoroughly vetted and engineered to extensive Micron quality standards. Upgrading to an SSD is one of the best ways to improve your system's performance, and now the price per gigabyte makes it a great time to ditch your hard drive. Start getting more out of your storage.",

Faster. Longer. The Crucial MX200 delivers 555 MB/s sequential reads on both compressible and incompressible data, and outperforms a typical hard drive by 400 MB/s. Even better, the performance doesn't let up, as the Crucial MX200 posts an endurance rating that's up to 5 times greater than a typical client SSD.Max out performance and increase reliability. Our engineers created RAIN technology to protect your data at the component level, similar to how RAID is used with multiple hard drives. This technology increases the security and protection of your data to a level that's rarely seen in consumer-class SSDs.Transfer and save large files in a matter of seconds. Competing SSDs typically rely on a fixed cache of multi-level cell flash memory, which allows you to write sequential data at published specs, but only for so long. Our industry-leading Dynamic Write Acceleration technology solves this problem by using an adaptable pool of high speed, single-level cell flash memory for consistently fast performance that doesn't let up. Encrypt and protect your data at the highest possible level. Keep personal files and sensitive information secure from hackers and thieves with AES 256-bit encryption - the same grade used by banks and hospitals. The Crucial MX200 meets or exceeds all industry encryption standards, including Microsoft&#174; eDrive, IEEE-1667, and TCG Opal 2.0.",

It features nCache&#8482; 2.0, SanDisk's next generation tiered caching technology, designed to improve SSD responsiveness for most corporate and consumer workloads.  The X300 is highly versatile and can accommodate a wide range of computing platforms. It is available in 2.5\" 7mm cased, M.2 2280, and mSATA form factors with capacities of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB.  nCache 2.0 Technology nCache 2.0 uses a combination of SLC and X3/TLC flash blocks to improve endurance, increase efficiency, and boost performance. By first writing all of the data to SLC blocks, the write amplification on the X3 blocks is minimized.  DataGuard Client The X300 SSD also includes a new and robust on-the-fly error handling mechanism called DataGuard Client. It uses page-level striping with distributed parity for an added layer of data protection and can recover errors that other traditional error correction mechanisms cannot.  Low Power The X300 utilizes a SATA DEVSLP low-power mode to minimize its power consumption during idle periods. DEVSLP enables the SSD to completely shut off its SATA PHY, thus resulting in much lower power consumption compared to SATA Slumber. This increases the amount of usable hours per battery charge, which is essential for modern mobile devices.  TCO SanDisk SSDs can improve total cost of ownership (TCO) by reducing downtime due to hard drive failures. They also offer lower latency and greater read/write speeds over traditional HDDs. IT departments can extend the useful life of their PC inventory by upgrading the HDDs to the X300 SSD, thus prolonging replacement cycles and maximizing asset value.",
