A DDR3 SODIMM will not fit into DDR2 or DDR memory sockets. (Information about which memory technology your system uses is included in the Crucial Memory Advisor tool.SODIMMs are smaller and thinner than regular DIMMs, and the 204-pin SODIMM PCBs are always ~2.6 inches long and are usually around 1.18 inches high (though the heights can vary slightly). They consist of a number of memory components (usually black) that are attached to a printed circuit board (usually green). The number of memory components on a 204-pin SODIMM\"s printed circuit board (PCB) can vary, but the PCB will always have 102 pins on the front and the back both, for a total of 204 pins.

The gold pins on the bottom of the DIMM provide a connection between the module and a socket on a larger printed circuit board.

(The Ballistix&#8482; and Ballistix Tracer&#8482; high-performance memory do not come in 72-bit or registered modules.) Standard DDR3 240-pin DIMMs are currently available in PC3-8500 (DDR3 1066MHz) and PC3-10600 (DDR3 1333MHz) speeds. Additional speeds will be added as the technology becomes available. To use DDR3 memory, your system motherboard must have 240-pin DIMM slots and a DDR3-enabled chipset. This is because a DDR3 SDRAM DIMM will not fit into a standard DDR2 DIMM socket or a DDR DIMM socket. The number of black components on a 240-pin DIMM can vary, but it always has 120 pins on the front and 120 pins on the back, for a total of 240. 240-pin DIMMs are approximately 5.25 inches long and 1.18 inches high, though the heights can vary. While 240-pin DDR3 DIMMS, 240-pin DDR2 DIMMs, 184-pin DDR DIMMs, and 168-pin DIMMs are approximately the same size, 240-pin DIMMs and 184-pin DIMMs have only one notch within the row of pins.","http://img.bbystatic.com/BestBuy_US/images/mp/products/1309/1309191/1309191970/1309191970_105x210_sc.jpg","http://img.bbystatic.com/BestBuy_US/images/mp/products/1309/1309191/1309191970/1309191970_54x108_s.gif","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/crucial-2gb-240-pin-dimm-ddr3-pc3-12800-memory-module-multi/1309191970.p?id=mp1309191970&skuId=1309191970",1309191970,null

To use DDR3 memory, your system must have both a 204-pin SODIMM slot and a chipset that supports DDR3 memory. A DDR3 SODIMM will not fit into DDR2 or DDR memory sockets. (Information about which memory technology your system uses is included in the Crucial Memory Advisor tool. SODIMMs are smaller and thinner than regular DIMMs, and the 204-pin SODIMM PCBs are always ~2.6 inches long and are usually around 1.18 inches high (though the heights can vary slightly). They consist of a number of memory components (usually black) that are attached to a printed circuit board (usually green). The number of memory components on a 204-pin SODIMM\"s printed circuit board (PCB) can vary, but the PCB will always have 102 pins on the front and the back both, for a total of 204 pins. The gold pins on the bottom of the SODIMM provide the connection between the memory module and the memory socket.","http://img.bbystatic.com/BestBuy_US/images/mp/products/1313/1313136/1313136684/1313136684_105x210_sc.jpg","http://img.bbystatic.com/BestBuy_US/images/mp/products/1313/1313136/1313136684/1313136684_54x108_s.gif","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/crucial-4gb-ddr3-pc3-14900-unbuffered-non-ecc-1-35v-multi/1313136684.p?id=mp1313136684&skuId=1313136684",1313136684,"3.0"

DDR3 is the latest generation of memory with an improved architecture that allows it to transmit data more quickly.A dual inline memory module (DIMM) consists of a number of memory components (usually black) that are attached to a printed circuit board (usually green). The gold pins on the bottom of the DIMM provide a connection between the module and a socket on a larger printed circuit board. The pins on the front and back of a DIMM are not connected to each other.Each 240-pin DIMM provides a 64-bit data path (72-bit for ECC or registered or Fully Buffered modules). (The Ballistix&#8482; and Ballistix Tracer&#8482; high-performance memory do not come in 72-bit or registered modules.) Standard DDR3 240-pin DIMMs are currently available in PC3-8500 (DDR3 1066MHz) and PC3-10600 (DDR3 1333MHz) speeds. Additional speeds will be added as the technology becomes available.To use DDR3 memory, your system motherboard must have 240-pin DIMM slots and a DDR3-enabled chipset. This is because a DDR3 SDRAM DIMM will not fit into a standard DDR2 DIMM socket or a DDR DIMM socket.The number of black components on a 240-pin DIMM can vary, but it always has 120 pins on the front and 120 pins on the back, for a total of 240. 240-pin DIMMs are approximately 5.25 inches long and 1.18 inches high, though the heights can vary. While 240-pin DDR3 DIMMS, 240-pin DDR2 DIMMs, 184-pin DDR DIMMs, and 168-pin DIMMs are approximately the same size, 240-pin DIMMs and 184-pin DIMMs have only one notch within the row of pins.","http://img.bbystatic.com/BestBuy_US/images/mp/products/1307/1307230/1307230213/1307230213_105x210_sc.jpg","http://img.bbystatic.com/BestBuy_US/images/mp/products/1307/1307230/1307230213/1307230213_54x108_s.gif","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/crucial-8gb-kit-4gbx2-240-pin-dimm-ddr3-pc3-8500-memory-module-multi/1307230213.p?id=mp1307230213&skuId=1307230213",1307230213,null
